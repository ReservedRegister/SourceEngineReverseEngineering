I only created a repo in the first place to just upload the source code on the cloud
the project was not designed to be pr'ed to
only "me" the programmer would have a good idea of how to utilize it because the goal of the project was to just fix the issues I wanted to fix not make it readable for others

edtrebuild.smx is required
